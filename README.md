# Short hands-on introduction to deep learning, with Keras.

## Installing Keras

Installing Theano and its dependencies is the hard part:

After that, a simple
```sudo pip install keras```
is enough, although the bleeding edge git version is often better than the pip version.

If you have an Nvidia video card, you are advised to also install CUDA and CuDNN.
The first steps of the Theano installation instructions explain how:

For Ubuntu:

For OS X:

TODO Check if pip version is compatible with our examples.
